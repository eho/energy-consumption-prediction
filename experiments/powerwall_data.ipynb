    "An exploratory data analysis on a time series data set is typically different from that of conventional/non-timeseries dataset. The [`template`](https://github.com/ZenithClown/ai-ml-project-template) provides some basic analysis techniques that is applicable to any type of datasets. The following methods are implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * [**Seasonal Decomposition**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/decompose-time-series-data-trend-seasonality/): The process of breaking a time series data into three main components - (I) trend, (II) seasonality, and (III) residuals/error terms.\n",
    "  * [**Check Data Stationarity**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/statistical-tests-to-check-stationarity-in-time-series-part-1/) Basic statistical models like `ARIMA` works on the principle that the time series is stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, first we copy the actual dataset into a copied variable (preserve original data), and understand the data to be applied on to the master series. In addition, we also set the date time indexing (with frequency, if not already available) since may functions (like ETS Decomposition) is dependent on it."
